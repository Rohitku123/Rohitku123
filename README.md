##  Projects & Highlights

### 1. Monte Carlo GBM Simulation
Simulates thousands of potential stock price paths using **Geometric Brownian Motion**, calculates **mean, median, std, percentiles, and probabilities**, and visualizes outcomes dynamically.

### 2. Credit Risk Modelling
Models **Probability of Default (PD)**, **Loss Given Default (LGD)**, and **Exposure at Default (EAD)**. Calculates **expected credit loss** for portfolios.

### 3. Market Risk / Value at Risk (VaR)
Implements **Parametric, Historical, and Monte Carlo VaR**, calculates **Conditional VaR**, and visualizes portfolio risk metrics.

### 4. Option Pricing Models
Implements **Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree, and Monte Carlo option pricing** and calculates Greeks for sensitivity analysis.

### 5. Multivariate-Time-Series-Analysis 
Python modules for **fetching data**, **Forcasting Time Series Analysis**, and creating **ARCH** **GARCH** **ARIMA/SARIMA-Model** using **R**.

##  Portfolio Highlights

- Simulated MSFT stock paths over 6 months using GBM  
- Estimated drift (μ ≈ 17%) and volatility (σ ≈ 26%) from historical data  
- Monte Carlo simulation generated **10,000 paths**, visualized dynamically  
- Extracted **statistical metrics** for **risk assessment and investment planning**  

> **Key insight:** Even with positive drift, volatility creates significant variation; probability of being above current price ≈ 64%, while short-term daily fluctuations can be negative ~49% of the time.
